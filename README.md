# Optimizing your Android App for Chrome OS

## This is not an official Google product

With the ability to run Android on Chromebooks, a huge 
ecosystem of applications and vast new functionality 
is now available to users. While this is great news 
for developers, certain optimizations are required 
to meet usability expectations and to make for an 
excellent user experience. 

This [code lab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/optimized-for-chromeos/index.html) will take you through 
the most common of these optimizations.

This repository contains the source code for the 
codelab in two different modules. **complete** contains
the completed codelab, **start** is the base project
with each step's code commented out for reference.
